shop includes

- main shop page - db is shop_products, and inventory page, cart, product modal, checkout, confirmaiton page
- we render page server side with SSG, get static props - then send it to the RTK store, with a reducer setProducts, and then we can use it in the app
- i then use a custom hook and a custom component, the hook setup and unsubscribed to the table to listen to changes, and warns if data is stale, the custom component
rerenders the by receiving a custom action to fire, the custom action just fetches new data and updates the store, which in turn updates the UI. we filter the rowIds to only refresh
if row being updates is in current view.
