A detailed list of adverse reactions is available in the SPC, which is available from the electronic Medicines Compendium website: www.medicines.org.uk and BNF www.bnf.org The following side effects are listed in the product SPC/BNF as common with aciclovir (but may not reflect all reported side effects): • Diarrhoea • Vomiting and nausea • Abdominal pain • Headache • Dizziness • Fever • Fatigue • Skin rashes or reactions (including photosensitivity and urticaria) Severe adverse reactions are rare, but anaphylaxis (delayed or immediate) has been reported and requires immediate medical treatment. In the event of a severe adverse reaction, the individual must be advised to stop treatment immediately and seek urgent medical advice. 

Management of and reporting procedure for adverse reactions 

• Healthcare professionals and individuals/carers/parents/guardians are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) using the Yellow Card reporting scheme on: https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk • Record all adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the individuals clinical record. • Report via organisation incident policy. • It is considered good practice to notify the individuals GP in the event of an adverse reaction. 

Written information to be given to individual/carer/par ent/guardian 

• Provide marketing authorisation holder's patient information leaflet (PIL) provided with the product. • Provide the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) patient information leaflet on shingles (herpes zoster infection) • The NHS website has patient information on shingles. • Give any additional information in accordance with the service specification. 

Individual advice / follow up treatment 

• Explain the dose, frequency and method of administration. • The individual/carer/parent/guardian should be advised to read the PIL. • Inform the individual/carer/parent/guardian of possible side effects and their management. • Advise individual/carer/parent/guardian to take the medication at regular intervals and to finish the course even if symptoms improve. • Advise individual/carer/parent/guardian that if a dose is missed it should be taken as soon as it is remembered unless it is nearly time for the next dose when it should be omitted. Advise then to take the next dose at the correct time. 
• Shingles usually resolves within 4 weeks – advise individual/carer/parent/guardian to seek medical advice if symptoms have not resolved within this time. • Advise individual/carer/parent/guardian to seek medical advice if symptoms worsen rapidly or significantly at any time or do not improve after completion of treatment course. • Advise individual/carer/parent/guardian to seek immediate medical attention (by calling 999 or going to A&E) if the individual develops signs or symptoms of sepsis. • Advise individual/carer/parent/guardian to seek medical advice if new vesicles are forming after 7 days of antiviral treatment, or healing is delayed. • Advise individual/carer/parent/guardian to seek medical advice if pain is inadequately controlled by over-the-counter analgesia. • The individual/carer/parent/guardian should be advised to seek medical advice in the event of an adverse reaction or if any other new symptoms develop. • Advise individual/carer/parent/guardian to return any unused medicines to a pharmacy for disposal: do not dispose of medicines in the bin, down the sink or toilet. • Advise individual/carer/parent/guardian to ensure the individual maintains adequate hydration particularly in the elderly to prevent renal impairment • Explain that only a person who has not had chickenpox or the varicella vaccine can catch chickenpox from a person with shingles. The person with shingles is infectious until all the vesicles have crusted over (usually 5–7 days after rash onset). • Advise individuals with shingles to: o Avoid contact with individuals who have not had chickenpox, particularly pregnant individuals, immunosuppressed individuals, and babies younger than 1 month of age. o Avoid sharing clothes and towels. o Wash their hands often. o Wear loose-fitting clothes to reduce irritation. o Cover lesions that are not under clothes while the rash is still weeping. o Avoid use of topical creams and adhesive dressings, as they can cause irritation and delay rash healing. o Keep the rash clean and dry to reduce the risk of bacterial superinfection. They should seek medical advice if there is an increase in temperature, as this may indicate bacterial infection. o Avoid work, school, or day care if the rash is weeping and cannot be covered. If the lesions have dried or the rash is covered, avoidance of these activities is not necessary.

DRESS is a specific, severe, unexpected reaction to a medicine, which affects several organ systems at the same time. It typically causes a combination of: • High fever • Morbilliform eruption • Haematological abnormalities • Lymphadenopathy • Inflammation of one or more internal organs. Onset is typically 2-6 weeks after first exposure (reduced to days after subsequent exposure). If signs and symptoms suggestive of DRESS appear, valaciclovir should be withdrawn immediately and the patient referred to a prescriber.
